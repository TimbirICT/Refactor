# Horiseon Marketing Services

A marketing management website.

## Description

A website designed for business owners to get management over their own marketing, as well as optimize search engines to choose what customers can see about their business online.

I added multiple semantic elements so the code is easier to understand, as well as added multiple comments describing the changes I made and their purpose. I also organized the classes and heading elements in the CSS file so they correspond in the order which they are presented in the HTML.

## Table of Contents

Search Engine Optimization: Helping business owners expand their reach, and providing customers best suited for your business.

Online Reputation Management: Managing what customers can see when using search engines to find out information on your business.

Social Media Marketing: Using analytics to find which social media platforms would provide the best leads for your business.
